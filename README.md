> Making a website is like piecing a puzzle, finding out what the client wants are the pieces.
It is our job as web developers to solve the puzzle.

I worked in a few projects, the most memorable project is when i worked ina team to develop Manly Volunteer Penguin Warden website. It was a challenge, doing the documentation and the coding of the website. Overall it was a fun experience. Do you have a puzzle that needs to be solved?..
My hobbies are
* Table tennis
